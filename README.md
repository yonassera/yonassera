### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate and self-driven software engineering student with a basic foundation in object-oriented programming and web technologies. I enjoy building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications, whether it's through C++ backends or modern web design using HTML and CSS.

I believe in writing readable code, learning by doing, and seeking for knowledge with the developer community. My focus is currently on strengthening my skills in full-stack development and exploring real-world applications of C# and Java in software systems.
